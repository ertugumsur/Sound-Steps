# Sound-Steps  

**Sound Steps** is an innovative project designed to revolutionize navigation for visually impaired individuals.  

---

## 1. Repository Contents  
- **3D Sound Generation Code:** Algorithms for creating spatial audio cues  
- **User Interface (UI):** Testing interface used in field trials with visually impaired participants  

---

## 2. Project Overview  
The UI allows testers to send **3D audio cues from 8 different directions**, enabling evaluation of how accurately participants can identify the soundâ€™s origin.  

---

## 3. Key Findings  
- Field tests revealed that providing navigation cues through **3D sounds embedded in music** was significantly more effective than using plain verbal instructions
