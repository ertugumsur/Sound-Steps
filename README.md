# Sound-Steps

Sound Steps is a innovative project that aims to revolutionize navigation for visually impaired individuals. This repository includes codes for the 3D sound creation and implemention and its UI for field testing with individuals.
The UI allows the tester to send 3d Sounds from 8 different directions to see how well visually impaired individuals can identify where the sound is coming from. The results obtained from these tests showed us that
giving directions to people using 3D sounds incorporated into music is much more effective than plain words of directions.
